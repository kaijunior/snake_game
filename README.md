# Snake Monster Eater

This is a simple snake game implemented using HTML5 and JavaScript. The game follows the traditional snake game mechanics with some additional features.

## Gameplay

In this game, you control a snake on a confined grid, and the goal is to grow your snake by having it eat monsters. 

- The snake moves in the direction specified by the arrow keys (up, down, left, and right). 
- A red monster appears randomly in the grid. If the snake eats a monster, the snake's length increases by one. 
- Additionally, blue blocks appear at random positions every 5 seconds. If the snake hits a block, the snake's length decreases by one and the block disappears. 
- The game employs a periodic boundary condition, where if the snake goes out of the grid on one side, it reappears on the opposite side. 
- The game has a time limit of 2 minutes. The remaining time is displayed on the top right corner of the screen.
- The current length of the snake is also displayed on the top right corner of the screen.
